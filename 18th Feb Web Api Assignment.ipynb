    "#Web Api Assignment\n",
    "\"\"\"Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software \n",
    "applications. It provides developers with standard commands for performing common operations so they do not have to \n",
    "write the code from scratch. An example of an API in real life is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to embed \n",
    "Google Maps into their own websites and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Advantages: \n",
    "1. APIs allow developers to access and use data from other applications without having to understand the underlying code. \n",
    "This makes it easier for developers to create new applications and services that integrate with existing systems.\n",
    "2. APIs can help reduce development time and costs by allowing developers to reuse existing code and functionality.\n",
    "3. APIs can help improve the user experience by allowing developers to create more intuitive and interactive applications.\n",
    "4. APIs can help increase security by providing a secure way for applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: \n",
    "1. APIs can be difficult to use and require a certain level of technical knowledge.\n",
    "2. APIs can be unreliable and may not always provide the expected results.\n",
    "3. APIs can be vulnerable to security threats such as malicious attacks or data breaches.\n",
    "4. APIs can be expensive to maintain and may require ongoing support and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: A Web API is an application programming interface (API) that is used to enable communication between web applications and \n",
    "servers. It allows developers to access and manipulate data from a remote source, such as a web server, in order to create \n",
    "web-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between an API and a Web API is that an API is a set of programming instructions and standards for \n",
    "accessing a web-based software application, while a Web API is an application programming interface that can be used to access \n",
    "web-based applications. An API provides the means for two applications to communicate with each other, while a Web API provides\n",
    "a way for developers to access and manipulate data from a remote source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing distributed systems. It is based on a \n",
    "client-server model, where the client sends requests to the server and the server responds with data. REST is stateless, \n",
    "meaning that each request from the client contains all of the information necessary for the server to process the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol for exchanging information between two systems. It is based on \n",
    "XML and uses HTTP as its transport protocol. SOAP messages are sent over the network and contain data in an XML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main shortcoming of SOAP is that it is complex and difficult to use. It requires a lot of configuration and setup, which \n",
    "can be time consuming. Additionally, SOAP messages are verbose and can be slow to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer):\n",
    "- REST is an architectural style for designing distributed systems.\n",
    "- It is based on a client/server model, where the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with data.\n",
    "- REST uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to communicate with the server.\n",
    "- REST is stateless, meaning that each request is independent of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):\n",
    "- SOAP is a protocol for exchanging information between two systems.\n",
    "- It uses XML to encode messages and is based on a request/response model.\n",
    "- SOAP requires the use of a web service to communicate with the server.\n",
    "- SOAP is stateful, meaning that each request is dependent on the previous one."
